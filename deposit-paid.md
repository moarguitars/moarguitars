			<p>Hey</p>
			<p>Thanks so much for putting your trust in me to make your commission. I have received your order and will be in touch the next time I am holding my phone, or sat at my desk.</p>
			<p>In the meantime try to settle on what kind of specs you might like for your build, which woods, what kind of pickups, and what ideas you have for the build.</p>
			<p>I canâ€™t wait to get it started!</p>
