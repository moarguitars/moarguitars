				<p>The wenge Wayfair family continues to grow. 5 of my current commissions are inspired  by this build. I can kinda see why!

What's hard to put across with photos, and even video, is the feel of a wenge hollowbody. There's a tightness to it, with an open, dry sound. Very special ❤️ #moarguitars

				<p>Just needs a volume pot and strings.

3kgs / 6.6lbs in weight currently, and this is with an Ash body, maple neck and bubinga fretboard. I'm very happy with how it feels in the hands.

Incredible to have customers (and friends!) all the way across the world, in Australia, thanks to this app. Very thankful for it all.

				<p>I've got this trio of unfinished stock bodies that are (literally) collecting dust in the workshop.

I'm probably busy with commissions for the rest of the year now, so probably won't have time to work on them.

So, is anyone interested in commissioning either an Ash hollow Morty or an alder hollow P bass? Get in touch, or go to my website to check out specs and options.</p>

				<p>By all reports this one is settling in beautifully at its new home in Indonesia with @limasenar . Huge temperature and humidity shifts are always a bit of a concern when shipping guitars so, as Ziva suggested, I put carbon support rods inside this neck, and it's rediculously stiff, like really stupidly stiff.

The guitar has a very tight feel and sound to it actually, I wonder if the carbon rods have something to do with it?</p>

				<p>I've been really overwhelmed by all the positive feedback, and visits to Moars new website. Recieved 2 orders within the first hour of being live! Crazy stuff.

Still another 24 hours to order a commission at 10% off, if you're interested go to the link in bio.

Also check out the upcoming  waiting list on my site to see if you can figure out what all these builds are. Here's a clue, one is going to New York, one Japan, one Odense, one Scotland and one  Australia.

				<p>Looking through some old builds of mine, and I really didn't spend enough time with this one. The soldiering iron was still hot when @alandublon landed in Copenhagen to collect it.

I think I only have about 4 photos of the build 😕

Can someone else order an Ash Wayfair built to the same specs so I can maybe have a day or so with it before it gets collected or shipped? Please?

				<p>I realised that lately I've been posting quite finished looking guitars, and less about the process. To be honest it's a bit scary, and makes me feel a bit vulnerable, showing what happens behind the scenes of a workshop. There's always mistakes, stuff to sand out, problems to solve, and mess. Lots of mess.
So I thought I should face my fears by showing one of these mistakes (or rather "design through process" ) on this hollow P bass I'm currently working on.

I like deep arm cuts on all my instruments, so I gave this guy the same treatment, but oh snap, I accidentally carved into the position where the bridge is going.

So one of my apprentices spent today carving a piece of bubinga (to match the fretboard) to act as a spacer between the curved body and the bridge. We will come up with a nice shape for it tomorrow to turn it into a design feature. It'll probably end up being the thing that I like the most about this build. It's often the f*~kups that end up being a projects best feature!</p>

				<p>I haven't been able to ship this guitar since completeting it a month or so ago, as its owner has been traveling, and then this corona thing happened (shipping is back to normal now though!) So rather then just let the guitar collect dust I've been adding layers oil most days, to pull abit more out of the grain, and frankly I think it's starting to look rediculous.</p>

				<p>I'm not quite at the final level of finish on this, hence the smudges and small lines on the body left over from earlier oil layers that I'll buff out before the final layer. But this guitar is looking so good. I think this might be one of my best oil finishes yet.

				<p>I'm a big fan of walnut these days. Very excited to have a few commissions with it coming in the following months. It's a lovely wood.</p>

				<p>To quote the person in my workshop today, listening to me test playing this; "wow man, that's EXACTLY what a guitar should sound like"

With just one vintage scatterwound P90 on the bridge side of centre. It's very hard to find a bad sound in this guitar.

Sometimes you're limitations are what make you fantastic ❤️

				<p>I know I posted this same guitar yesterday, but my god this thing plays well, so I decided it deserved a second day in the limelight.

I don't often get time (or maybe I don't often give myself time) to pause and enjoy when I'm testing a guitar, as I'm mainly just scrutinising for things that could be that 1% better, but I lost track of time playing on this one.. My love affair with P90s grows ever deeper.

				<p>First photo of a new commission I was working on today. You can still see the chainsaw marks from carving the top.
Any guesses as to what it might be?

				<p>This guitar is in need of a loving home, make me an offer via the reverb link in bio if you're interested! I've helped to smooth the process by dropping a little off the price 😉

All specs are in the reverb ad 👍

				<p>I'm going to start a weekly workshop diary over on YouTube to show you guys some stuff from behind the scenes, and to document what goes on, and just have a bit of a chat... With myself.
Extremely high budget stuff.

				<p>I've gotten quite a few orders for walnut guitars over the past few weeks, and I think this guitar is the culprit! It's a really really cool wood.

Dense, light and hard with beautiful grain and colour (that's what she said...) This guitar is about to go to its new owner in the states, will be exciting to see how it progresses..</p>

				<p>A couple of Wayfair foetuses caught in the wild.

Lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of sanding, carving and refining left to do... #moarwayfair #moarguitars #hollowbodyguitar #archtopguitar #fholes #carvedtopguitar #hollowbodybass

				<p>Did you guys know that I wind all my own pickups? This gives me the flexibility to do more or less anything for each individual order, and each pickup is wound specifically for each customer (I don't have a massive stash of P90s) I wind each one with a specific player, guitar and tone in mind

They also sound really really good.

				<p>Right then guys! I think I've made enough of these, and they are different enough from the original, to warrant their own name, like my Wayfair, I need a name for my hollow or solid T's.

Got any ideas? .

				<p>I know I'm maybe a little biased but I really love this guitar. Modern playability with a natural feel, and a resonant, vibrant and warm sound that works with what you give it.</p>

				<p>Left or right and why?

I'm a bit torn. I love them both, for different reasons.

It's amazing how different these two guitars are actually, when coming from such similar places, and sharing the same lines.</p>
