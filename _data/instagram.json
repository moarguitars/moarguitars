Lots of mess.\nSo I thought I should face my fears by showing one of these mistakes (or rather \"design through process\" ) on this hollow P bass I'm currently working on.\n\nI like deep arm cuts on all my instruments, so I gave this guy the same treatment, but oh snap, I accidentally carved into the position where the bridge is going.\n\nSo one of my apprentices spent today carving a piece of bubinga (to match the fretboard) to act as a spacer between the curved body and the bridge. We will come up with a nice shape for it tomorrow to turn it into a design feature. It'll probably end up being the thing that I like the most about this build.

How authentic and cool is that!?! Anyway he left me one of his Nebula drive pedals to put on my new workshop board. It sounds great, very fat and round with a smooth high end, even at high gain settings.
