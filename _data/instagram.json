To be honest it's a bit scary, and makes me feel a bit vulnerable, showing what happens behind the scenes of a workshop. There's always mistakes, stuff to sand out, problems to solve, and mess. Lots of mess.\nSo I thought I should face my fears by showing one of these mistakes (or rather \"design through process\" ) on this hollow P bass I'm currently working on.\n\nI like deep arm cuts on all my instruments, so I gave this guy the same treatment, but oh snap, I accidentally carved into the position where the bridge is going.\n\nSo one of my apprentices spent today carving a piece of bubinga (to match the fretboard) to act as a spacer between the curved body and the bridge. We will come up with a nice shape for it tomorrow to turn it into a design feature. It'll probably end up being the thing that I like the most about this build.

Simple things become more of a challenge at greater scale. \nI sneaked into the workshop today to try to catch up a little and I finally feel like I've finally broken the back of the work for the Naked Mortys. Almost all the woodwork is done. S**T I cant wait to show you all!\n\nI'm also very excited to do some sort of a tone test for 14 guitars, made with similar pickups (all scatter hand wound by yours truly)but with different woods and pup locations.

So I could easily compare a scalloped to a non scalloped nut on guitars with otherwise identical woods, body shapes and neck carves. \n\nSo I tried one out and was amazed at the difference.
