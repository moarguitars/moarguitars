			<h2>Thank you!</h2>
			<p>I make very limited runs of hand made merch and sell it here.</p>
			<p>I am currently all out of stock but if you want to support me by buying me a coffee, pay for a set of strings or just to say thanks for a question I answered regarding a guitar build of yours, please feel free to donate via paypal here. Itâ€™s really really appreciated!</p>
