			<p>My background is actually much more as a player then as a woodworker. Growing up I always modded my own guitars, but playing was much more at the forefront of my mind, rather then building. In my 20’s I had a bit of success as a guitarist and a songwriter, touring a little, recording a lot, gigging loads and trying (unsuccessfully!) to get various projects off the ground. It was during this time that I started cutting comfort cuts into tele’s, stripping finish off of necks, and gradually easing my way into more and more difficult “luthier” type tasks. I made a bit of a name for myself as a guitar tech locally in Copenhagen, repairing, modding and customising guitars for other guys on the scene, and eventually took the courage to make my first guitar.</p> 
			<p>To my amazement this guitar sold very quickly, then the next, then someone wanted one built a little like it, but with a different wood, and I have had commissions ever since.</p>
			<p>I think my unique approach to guitars comes from my perspective as a player, rather then as a carpenter. I used to cycle around Copenhagen with a guitar on my back all day, going from rehearsals in the morning, to teaching private guitar classes in the afternoon, and then gigging the same night. So to me a guitar has to be light (as it’s always on you) has to be inspiring to play acoustically, has to be set up to be comfortable to play for 8 hours a day, has to be versatile, comfortable on the body, has to stay in tune and be reliable in a professional setting, has to resonate. These are the key elements to me when building a good guitar.</p>
