                <p>My unique and carefully hand-crafted guitars are played on stages all around the world, but each one starts its journey from my workshop in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>

                <p>Over the best part of the last decade my business has grown rapidly, but my core approach, ethos and passion has remained. Moar Guitars is a bold, independent small business; the person answering your emails is the same thatâ€™s winding your pickups. I work on a one-on-one basis to meticulously craft every aspect of the build, tailored exactly to your specifications.</p>
