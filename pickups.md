			<h2>Pickups</h2>
			<p>I wind all my own pickups. Each time one of my guitars is ordered I chat to the customer about what kind of pickups they want, what kind of sound they have in mind, what kind of output they want, what kind of circuit they would like, what aesthetic they want, what other guitars they have, what they think they are currently missing in their rig, what their favourite pedal is, what their favourite guitar sound is, what kind of music they have in mind when they think about the commissioned build, etc etc.</p>
			<p>Each pickup I wind is made specifically for each build. I don’t have a stock of pre-wound pickups, (mainly because I don’t have the time to wind them!) but you can be sure that when you order one of my guitars the pickup in it was made especially for you!</p>
			<p>So whatever you have in mind, however bizarre or classic, get in touch. I can make it work.</p>
