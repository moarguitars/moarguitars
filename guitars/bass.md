description: Let’s be honest. Basses are cooler than guitars. I can write this here, publically for all to see, as all guitarists are too busy searching my site for the various colour options of binding to match the LEDs of their spaceship pedal boards, to come onto the bass section of my page. I’m not going to patronise you with a snappy headline, I love making basses, I would love to make you one. Check them out. If you can’t see what you would like then get in touch. I can probably make what you want.
