modeldesc: My most recent addition to the Moar model catalogue is the as of yet un-named Moar Offset (Have a good idea for a name? [Submit it here]()!) They share a lot of characteristics with the Hollow Mortys, with an all access set neck joint, totally hollow body with no centre block, big belly and arm cuts. But with a body design that wants to be looked at. The F hole is oversized, the weight is low, it has corners in unusual places. See more about them here.
