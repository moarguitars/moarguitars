modeldesc: Dolly is the everyday inspiration machine you can rely on. Simple, stable, resonant, repairable, lightweight, long lasting, versatile and virtuosic and each one is built entirely around you and your sound.

The first guitar you grab in the studio. The guitar you take on tour, the guitar you can easily modify for new sounds as you evolve, the guitar that doesn’t punish your back or your hands after a long, late night session, the guitar that doesn’t get boring playing on acoustically for a days teaching. It is perfect at what it does.

They come as standard with beautiful 2 piece roasted mahogany bodies, roasted mahogany necks, ebony fretboards, medium stainless steel frets, 42.5mm scalloped bone nuts, 12” radius’ and a slim D profile neck. Average build weight is 2.8kgs/6.1lbs.

Spec yours below, I can't wait to make you your new Dolly!
