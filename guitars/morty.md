modeldesc: My most stripped back guitar is the Solid-Morty. You still get stainless steel frets, the same hardware as you get on my Wayfairs, a modern all access set neck joint, handwound pickups made to your specs, but everything unnecessary is removed. It is a distilled, pure and refined instrument.
