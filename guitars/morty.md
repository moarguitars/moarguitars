description: All you need in a guitar and nothing else. Built on a perfect foundation, simplicity can be more of an inspiration than a limitation.

modeldesc: My most stripped back guitar is the Solid-Morty. You still get stainless steel frets, the same hardware as you get on my Wayfairs, a modern all access set neck joint, handwound pickups made to your specs, but everything unnecessary is removed. It is a distilled, pure and simple instrument.
