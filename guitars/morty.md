model: Solid Morty
price: 1500usd / 10,000dkk
modeldesc: My most stripped back guitar is the Solid-Morty. You still get stainless steel frets, the same hardware as you get on my Wayfairs, a modern all access set neck joint, handwound pickups made to your specs, but everything unnecessary is removed. It is a distilled, pure and simple instrument.

model2: Hollow Morty
price2: 1800usd / 12,000dkk
modeldesc2: My Hollow Mortyâ€™s are made to be comfortable, resonant, inspiring to play acoustically and versatile. They are totally hollow, with no centre block, to maximise resonance and keep the weight down.  But I vary the thickness of the top, back and sides to add strength and support where needed, whilst removing all unnecessary material. This gives me a lot of extra control on my builds. For example if the customer knows they will be playing on very loud stages I can add a little extra thickness to the top to help control feedback, or if you want to feel vibrations against your chest when you play I can make the back a little thinner on the belly cut.
